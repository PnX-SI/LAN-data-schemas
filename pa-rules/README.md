## Protected areas rules data schema

The protected areas data schema allows to harmonize the way basic information about protected areas rules are published and shared.

It is based on LAN project workshops with European partners and an alalysis of existing data ([WDPA](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/wdpa?tab=WDPA), 
[OSM](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dprotected_area), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q473972), [Digitize the planet](https://content.digitizetheplanet.org/en/api/docs/v2/)).

It aims to be compatible with: 
- Digitize the planet data model for rules (https://digitizetheplanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/englisch-1.pdf)
- French CNIG working group an natural areas and their rules (https://cnig.gouv.fr/gt-espaces-naturels-proteges-a26277.html)
